    <p class="headline">Pollution is a rising danger: 5 groups of people who should be most cautious</p>
    <p>
        Pollution levels have surged significantly in recent years, posing increasing threats to public health, the environment, and everyday life. Air, water, and soil pollution from factories, vehicles, and improper waste disposal affect everyone, but some people are at even higher risk from these hazards. Certain groups must take extra precautions or seek alternatives to minimize exposure and stay healthy. This article highlights five groups most vulnerable to pollution and emphasizes protective actions for each.
    </p>
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>
        Children are more sensitive to pollutants due to their developing bodies and higher intake of air and water relative to their size. Exposure can cause respiratory issues, hinder development, and increase susceptibility to illness. Protective measures at home and school environments are especially important.
    </p>
    <h3>Elderly adults</h3>
    <p>
        Seniors often have weaker immune systems and existing health conditions, making them vulnerable to pollution-induced complications such as aggravated asthma, heart disease, and decreased lung function. Extra care and regular medical checkups help reduce risks.
    </p>
    <h3>Respiratory patients</h3>
    <p>
        People with asthma, bronchitis, or other respiratory problems may face worsening symptoms and flare-ups due to polluted air. Even short exposure can trigger breathing difficulties, so monitoring air quality and using protective masks is critical.
    </p>
    <h3>Pregnant women</h3>
    <p>
        Pollution exposure during pregnancy increases risks for both mother and baby, such as birth defects, low birth weight, and potential health complications. Staying indoors during high pollution days helps protect maternal and infant health.
    </p>
    <h3>Outdoor workers</h3>
    <p>
        People who work outside, like construction laborers and street vendors, inhale more pollutants daily and face higher chances of long-term health effects. Using protective gear and periodic health monitoring mitigate occupational hazards from pollution.
